# Nodes

Computers running the bitcoin program.

## What is a node?

A node is just a **computer that is running the Bitcoin program**. More importantly, it is connected to other computers (running the same program) to create a Network.

## What does a node do?

A node has three jobs:

### 1. Follow rules

Each node (bitcoin client) has been programmed to follow a set of rules. By following these rules a node is able to check the transactions it receives and only relay them if everything is cool. If there are any problems, the transaction isn’t passed on.

For example, one rule is that a person must own an equal or greater amount of bitcoins than they are trying to send. So if your node receives a transaction where someone has tried to send more bitcoins than they own, the transaction won’t be passed on to other nodes.
